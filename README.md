# 🏠 House Price Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property details.

## 🔍 Project Goals
Predict accurate house prices using historical housing data.

Understand which features impact house prices the most.

Build and compare different regression models to improve accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains house-related features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and price. It is used to train models to predict house prices.
